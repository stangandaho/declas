## Windows Installation 🪟
---

### Option 1: Run Executable
1. [Download](https://zenodo.org/records/14835188/files/Declas_080225.zip?download=1) the zip file.

2. Unzip the downloaded file and go into `Declas` folder. Double-click `Declas.exe` file to launch the software.
3. Create a shortcut on Desktop (optional) pressing `Shift` + `Right click` on `Declas.exe`. Got to `Send to` -> `Desktop (create shortcut)`. On the Desktop, the shortcut can be renamed as `Declas`.

### Option 2: Install from source
### 1. Install Prerequisites
#### a. Python Installation
1. Download and install Python 3.7+ from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Important**: During installation, ensure that the option to **"Add Python to PATH"** is selected.

3. Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and running:

   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

#### b. Git Installation
Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/). During the installation, use the default settings. Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and running:

```bash
git --version
```

#### c. Optional: Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To create a virtual environment, run the following commands in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```
You will need to activate the virtual environment by running `venv\Scripts\activate`.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository by running the following commands in Command Prompt:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/declas.git
cd declas
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Inside the project directory, install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the virtual environment is activated if you're using one.

### 4. Run the Software
To run the Declas software, execute the following in Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Linux Installation 🐧
---
### 1. Install Prerequisites
#### a. Python Installation

1. Open a terminal and install Python 3.7+ using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

2. Verify the installation:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

#### b. Git Installation
To clone the repository, Git must be installed. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

#### c. Optional: Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's a good idea to use a virtual environment to isolate dependencies. Set up a virtual environment with:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll need to activate the virtual environment doing: `source .venv/bin/activate`.

### 2. Clone the Repository
Once Git is installed, clone the repository using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stangandaho/declas.git
cd declas
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Inside the project directory (`declas`), install the required Python libraries by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure the virtual environment is activated before running the above command if you're using one.

### 4. Run the Software
Once all dependencies are installed, you can run the Declas software using:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

## macOS Installation 🍏
---
### 1. Install Prerequisites
#### a. Python Installation
1. Open the terminal and install Python 3.7+ using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). If you don’t have Homebrew installed, first install it by running:

   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install Python:

## Troubleshooting
### Common Issues
1. **Pip not found or outdated**:
   - If you encounter an error related to `pip`, ensure that `pip` is installed and up to date:
   
     ```bash
     python -m ensurepip --upgrade
     pip install --upgrade pip
     ```

2. **Permission Denied (Linux/macOS)**:
   - If you encounter permission issues during installation, try using `pip` with `sudo` (Linux/macOS):

     ```bash
     sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Virtual Environment Not Activated**:
   - Ensure that your virtual environment is activated before running `pip install` or `python main.py`.

4. **Python Not Recognized on Windows**:
   - If you encounter errors like "python not recognized", ensure Python was added to the system's PATH. You can modify the PATH manually through **System Properties > Environment Variables** or reinstall Python with the option to add to PATH selected.
